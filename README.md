# ProxyMiny - Your little pick to test Proxied requests on your system !
It's a simple Python Script that lets you send request to an URL (testing purposes only) via proxy addresses read from the 'proxies.txt' file. Proxyminy will try to sumbit an http, https, socks4/5 request for as many requests you want to send.
It's been written for security and testing purposes only, I do not assume any responsability.

# Requirements
- Python 2/3 (you will need to convert some functions like 'raw_input' or 'print' in order to make it working)

Currently tested and working on Linux Based Sistems.
